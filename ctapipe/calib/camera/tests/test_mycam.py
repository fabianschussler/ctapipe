This is a template for the camera prototypes for
a uniform implementation of the test functions corresponding
to the different camera calibration functions.

WE ENCOURAGE to follow the current template together with the
coding guidelines document:

FUNCTIONS: In mycam.py module exists two exmaple functions
- calibration_constant_calculation(): functions that calculates
calibration constants.
- pedestal_substraction(): functions that applies
the calculated calibration constant to the raw data for its calibration.

Here there is an example of the propossed naming scheme
appending at the beginning og the name function "test_"
for the function implemented in the mycam.py module


IMPORTANT: if the current scheme, for any reason does not fit into
your camera calibration, please contact DATA experts to search for
common alternatives.
